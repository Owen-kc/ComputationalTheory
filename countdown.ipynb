    "# Introduction\n",
    "***\n",
    "The Countdown numbers game is a mathematical component of the popular television programme *Countdown*. In the numbers round of the show, the contestants are tasked to use arithmetic operations to reach a specified target number. The contestants are given six randomly selected numbers, with which they can add, subtract, divide and multiply to achieve this. While the goal of the game is relatively simple, the game introduces a varying set of circumstances which results in a unique game for each respective set of contestants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective of the Assignment\n",
    "The objective of the assignment is to enhance our computational thinking skills by engaging with a problem which mirrors the comlpexity and unpredictability of real world scenarios. The main objectives of the assignment can be categorized as follows, as per the assignment brief:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify difficult computational problems in everyday computing:** Using the Countdown numbers game, we can explore how seemingly relatively simple concepts can unfold into complex computational challenges, requiring specific considerations and critical thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the common models of computation:** We will investigate the common models of computation behind the Countdown numbers game. This process will include understanding the principles of the common models of computation, ensuring this understanding will guide us to developing a consistent and acceptable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Design computer programs using a variety of computational paradigms:** The assignment will evolve around the use of a specific function, `solve_numbers`, which will take a variety of computational paradigms, building upon the basis of our understanding of the common models of computation. This function will seek to solve the numbers game challenge, while providing a flexible and practical experience based on our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analyse the complexity of an algorithm:** An important part of the assignment is to analyze and evaluate the efficiency and complexity of our solution. This proces involves thoroughly investigating each component of our solution, ensuring that it meets expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will thoroughly investigate the Countdown numbers game, analyzing its constraints and rules, to implement a thorough solution. The `solve_numbers` function, implemented through Python and its mathematical frameworks, will utilize computational paradigms while building upon the common models of computation to solve the problem of the numbers game efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Countdown Numbers Game\n",
    "The numbers game begins with the selection of the six numbers, which is made up of two different sets of numbers. **Large** numbers, which are made up of one copy of 25, 50, 75 and 100, and **small** numbers which are made up of two sets of the numbers 1-10. The contestant then is able to choose a combination of these numbers, by first selecting between one and four large numbers, with the remaining numbers being made up of the numbers of the 1-10 set. A target number is then generated, with this number being between 101 and 999 inclusive. Contestants are then given 30 seconds to use addition, subtraction, division and multiplication to reach the target number using using any combination of the six chosen numbers. Each of the numbers can only be utilized once in the calculation, ensuring that the number remains a whole number at each step."

    "## Strategic Considerations and Perceived Biases\n",
    "The selection of these numbers also introduces complex strategic considerations. Each respective player may have a different approach to choosing numbers based on their own stregth and familiarity with the game. For example, a specific player might feel that they are more comfortable with an emphasis on small numbers, as it provides more control over incremental or minute adjustments to the number, while another player may rely on large numbers as it is more straightforward to reach large numbers. Each approach has it's own strengths and weaknesses, along with some potential biases. With the context of the example selections above, we can explain the potential advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All Small Numbers**: A selection of all small numbers allows for a wide range of options for incremental adjustments, providing precise control to the contestant. Working with smaller numbers can also be easier to calculate in the moment. However, without large numbers, it can be difficult to reach high target values efficiently, increasing the complexity of the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mixed Numbers**: This strategy offers a balanced approach, with an equal share of numbers, it provides flexibility, and can easily reach a wide range of target numbers. With more options at their disposal, players might face a challenge of which route to take to reach the target number, but overall, this approach is considered the most versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heavy Large Numbers**: Large numbers make it easier to reach high targets with fewer operations, and with many large numbers it typically simplifies the initial calculations, as there is a straightforward path with the given numbers. However, this also means its difficult to make small adjustments, especially if the target number is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "These approcahes have their own advantages and disadvantages, with the all small numbers and heavy large numbers approaches being high risk, high reward, while the mixed numbers approach is flexible and versatile. A situation might arise where a player takes the risk and goes with an emphasis on large numbers, and the target value in this game ends up being high, potentially giving them an advantage over someone with another approach. Overall, the mixed numbers approach, with either 3 small numbers, 3 large numbers, or 4 small numbers, 2 large numbers, provides the most flexibility while reducing risk. This approach is considered by many to be optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biases\n",
    "When covering a game that involves any form of strategic considerations and random chance, it's important to address potential biases. Perceived biases are not only impacted by the mathematical section of the game, but also by contestants personal strengths and experiences, as well as the context of the game and the willingness to take risks. \n",
    "\n",
    "To cover the topic of biases, we must first look at the target number from the numbers game. In the generation of the target number, we know that the median of the numbers 101 -> 999 is 550. To confirm this, we can define a method below to generate a random number between in this range, and repeat this process 100 times to get the average result across the executions. We would expect this number to be around 550."

    "We can see above that the average target number is typically somewhere around 550, as expected. This introduces a potential bias for contestants to consider, and poses a question:  ***Why would contestants ever diverge from a mixed number approach in the number selection process?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a valid question, as it's clear that the mixed number strategy provides a balanced approach, and considering we know that the median of the numbers is 550, it's likely that the target number will fall within a section of the range that favours the flexibility and versatility of the mixed number strategy. The strategy may struggle with extremely high numbers (850+) and extremely low numbers (>250), but outside of those ranges it's probable that the mixed numbers approach won't face much difficulty in its calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategic Bias, Statisical Bias, and Psychological Bias\n",
    "It's clear that there is a potential strategic bias towards the mixed numbers approach. However, it's important to note that the game, statistically, does not inherently favour this approach. There is an equal chance for any number within range to be selected as the target number, therefore there is no perfect, consistent strategy. Both the strategic and statistical bias can be heavily influenced by the psychological bias of each contestant. A contestant's psychological bias on a certain strategy may influence their decision. By adopting the mixed number strategy, a widely endorsed approach, which provides flexibility and balance, a contestant might as a consequence feel more comfortable with their calculations and perform better in the game. By understanding the difference between these biases, and recognizing their own strengths, a contestant can make a more informed decision, offering a greater chance of success."

    "# Approach and Methodology\n",
    "***\n",
    "In this section, we explore the design of the algorithm and the approach we will use to address the Countdown numbers game. The focus of this section is to lay the foundation for the `solve_numbers` function, and consider what strategy and approach would best suit the function. This section will cover the algorithmic design and considerations of the function, as well as explain how functional programming principles can be utilized in tandem with reverse polish notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Translating Countdown to a Programme\n",
    "Given that Countdown is played in a non-digital context, we must first define how the numbers round can be efficiently transferred to a programming context.\n",
    "### Input Parameters\n",
    "The initial steps of the Countdown numbers game includes defining the randomly chosen numbers and the target number, as defined previously in the notebook. We know that there are two pools of numbers for the number selection process, small numbers (**1-10 x 2**), and large numbers (**25, 50, 75, 100**), and we know that the target number is a randomly generated number from **101-999**. These numbers act as the input parameters that the programme will calculate from. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Randomly Selecting Numbers**: From the small numbers pool (two instances of each number from 1 to 10), four are randomly chosen, and from the large numbers pool (25, 50, 75, and 100), two are selected. This combination of numbers can be changed if required, but will initially begin with 4 small numbers and 2 large numbers for a common approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generating the Target Number**: The target number is randomly generated within the specified range (101 to 999). This number sets the goal for the player, or in our case, the algorithm, to achieve using arithmetic operations constrained by the game rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will randomly generate each of these numbers each time the function is executed, so as to follow the traditional rules of the Countdown numbers round and ensure the function is being tested appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Rules\n",
    "It's important that the function recognizes the games rules and constraints during the calculation process, ensuring that the function accurately calculates solutions fairly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Use of Numbers**: As per the game requirements, numbers can only be used once during the solution process. \n",
    "- **Valid Operations**: Common mathematical operators can be used during the calculation process, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. However, the code explicitly must check for:\n",
    "    - **Subtraction**: Ensure that there is not a negative number at any point of the calculation process.\n",
    "    - **Division**: Ensure that division doesn't result in a fractional result.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method must be defined to validate each of these rules, ensuring each potential solution the function outputs is legitimate and fair under the games rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve_numbers` function outputs the results of the computational attempts to solve the Countdown numbers round. The method should print the outputs in a user-friendly, readable manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Successful Solutions**: Each successful solution should be outputted by the function, as well as a total count of the amount of solutions that were deemed correct.\n",
    "- **No Solutions**: If there are no solutions, the function should briefly inform the user that there was no solution found, indicating the function was unable to find a solution to with the specified numbers.\n",
    "- **Structure**: The method should output the steps of the calculation process, rather than the calculation only. This means that each step in the process to reach the target number should be included with the output, as well as the solution in it's entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining these aspects, and how they could transfer to a programming context, we can better construct the design of the functions and algorithm overall, leading to a more efficient and realistic simulation of the Countdown numbers game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Programming\n",
    "Functional programming is a paradigm that encourages the use of pure functions, immutability and higher-order functions. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative and its application in Python can enhance code maintainability, readability and efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutability\n",
    "Immutability referes to the concept that data structures should not be modified after they are created. Any function that needs to utilize data should create and return a new sample rather than changing existing structure. This helps eliminate errors related to data changes and data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance to Countdown**:\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Each state of a specific game will remain unchanged through the process of execution. This ensures each step can be predicted and repeated if required, such as for debugging or verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operations**: The algorithm will utilize operations for the calculations of the numbers game, such as addition or subtraction. Utilizing these operations inherently produces consistent results for a specific set of numbers, which is crucial for the calcualtion process, and verification if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety**: The algorithm will explore numerous possible solutions at the same time, so ensuring that these calculations are following thread-safe operations is essential to a fair and accurate solution. Immutability enables safer processing in the context of the Countdown numbers game as it enables multiple threads or processes to operate on immutable data structures at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-order Functions\n",
    "Higher-order functions are functions that can take one or more functions as an input and returns an entirely new function. This is particularly useful as it enables the creation of flexibile and reusable code segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance to Countdown**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Higher-order functions enable the creation of modular and reusable components. This is relevant to Countdown as functions that perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication or division can be passed as arguments to other functions efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: By utilizing higher-order functions, traditionally complex logic can be abstracted into simpler, more manageable segments, making the overall architecture easier to debug, maintain, and modify. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of immutability and higher-order functions for the Countdown numbers game grants safety in concurrency and significantly improves the modularity and reusability of components by abstracting operations into simpler functions, making the system easier to maintain and extend if required [5, 6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reverse Polish Notation\n",
    "Reverse Polish Notation, often referred to as postfix notation, is a method for writing expressions where each operator follows all of its operands. RPN removes the need for parentheses required by infix notation, which simplifies the computational logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "RPN eliminates the need for parentheses or brackets for calculations, and does not require any hierarchy at all. This leads to a more straightforward parsing process, and in the context of the Countdown numbers game, where there is potential for many different combinations of mathematical operators and numbers. Without the need for operator precedence or parentheses, RPN reduces the chance that errors could arise from misinterpretation of operation order. Each operator in RPN follows its operands, so the sequence of operations is straightforward. Utiziling a stack based algorithm, RPN also utilizes memory efficiently, which is particulary useful for the Countdown numbers game, as numerous combinations and examples are tested concurrently or quickly [7]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Infix Notation vs Reverse Polish Notation\n",
    "Consider the following infix notation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$(2 + 3) * 4$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, operators are placed between operands, and parentheses are necessary to define the natural order of operations. Without parentheses, the notation would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$2 + 3 * 4$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notation above without parentheses, the multiplication would take priority over addition, resulting in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$2 + 3 * 4 = 14$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This result is actually not correct. When utilizing parentheses, the correct result would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(2 + 3) * 4 = 20$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the same expression in RPN would be defined as `2 3 + 4 *`. In this express, no parentheses are required, the operations are performed when they are available. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `2 3 +` pushes `2` and `3` onto the stack, then adds them to get `5`.\n",
    "- `5 4 *` then multiplies `5` by `4` to yield `20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These distinctions highlight why RPN is particularly suited for the Countdown numbers game, where efficient parsing and evaluation are essential.\n",
