# Computational Theory

In this project, we solve the [numbers round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Numbers_Round) of the popular TV show, [Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)), through the use of Python in this Jupyter notebook.

## Topic & Context

In the numbers round of countdown, contestants choose six numbers from a predefined set (two sets of integers 1-10, one set of 25, 50, 75, 100), and use these given numbers to add, subtract, divide and multiply to achieve a result based on a randomly generated three digit number between 101-999. Each number can onlt be used once, and the operations must result in whole numbers, meaning there can't be any fractions or decimals at any point in the process. The contestants are timed, and must complete their answer within 30 seconds.
